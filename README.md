# Client-side 3NWeb platform

This repository contains client-side 3NWeb platform.
Platform's core talks 3NWeb protocols with servers, does all of crypto, keeps all user's keys, and provides an easy-to-use API for apps that run in 3NWeb platform.

This is a desktop implementation of 3NWeb platform, and it uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/).
Platform's core runs as a main process, while apps run in renderer processes.


## Platform setup notes

Some of the used packages may need local recompilation, like node-fuse-bindings for mounting storage's file systems into native OS, requiring some setup.

### Linux

The following kitchen sink is apt-ed in Ubuntu, besides node:
```
apt-get install -y make gcc gcc-multilib g++ g++-multilib pkg-config build-essential libfuse-dev fuse
```

### Windows

Install:
- node, minimum version 18.x. In GUI installer check option that installs chocolatery with the whole kitchen sink that also pulls in Visual Studio libraries.
- git with included MINGW that has bash and other things for reuse of scripts on Windows.
- [Dokany](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany) to give FUSE on Windows. Ensure to check installation of files for development, else C headers won't be available.

Ensure that bash is accessible in path. Adding something like `C:\Program Files\Git\bin` to `PATH` environment variable will help. Adjust path in admin console with `setx path /M ...`, else you may have repeating entries, coupled with hard 1024 char limit.


### Mac


## Usage

To use this repo, you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), minimum version 18.x.

First run
```
npm ci
```
that will restore packages in accordance to package-lock, including development tools like TypeScript.
Some post-install scripts are also present, beware on updates of dependencies and just rely on pair of remove-all and npm-ci.

Use npm scripts:
```
npm run
```
will show different available tasks.

When you update/change any npm dependencies, remove `node_modules` and run `npm ci` to have clean setup. Otherwise you may get non-obvious errors.
